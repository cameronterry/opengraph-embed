Making all URLs work like oEmbed through OpenGraph, even if the URL does not have an oEmbed endpoint.

== Description ==
A nicer and simple way of sharing or referencing content from other websites which do not support oEmbed. OpenGraph Embed will automagically convert URLs which sit standalone on a line within the text editor into a embed card similar.

Inspired by [New Embeds Feature in WordPress 4.4](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/new-embeds-feature-in-wordpress-4-4/) which turned all WordPress-powered websites into oEmbed providers. OpenGraph Embed with any luck, will cover the other 75% of the internet using another CMS.
